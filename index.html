<p> I published a story giving a market overview of the electric vehicle market in Washington. I tried to give the user all the tools they would need to view the information in as many ways as they might find useful. As a result, I do not really tell a story to make a point, but I made two dashboards to show information in an increasing granularity. The first dashboard gives an overview of the market on a state-wide level and shows how the market has grown over time and also allows for viewing this information on the level of the manufacturer. To show this information, I started with the total number of electric vehicles (evs) and the market value of all the evs. Below this, I added a bar chart showing the market share of each manufacturer. The x- axis is the total value of the manufacturer in Washington, and text displays it as a percentage of the total value across all manufacturers. Next, there is a line chart showing the total market over time. This is pretty straightforward. Finally, I also included a tree chart showing the value of battery vehicles and plug-in hybrids, since these are the main categories of electric vehicles. I added text where appropriate to give exact numbers. The user can click on a manufacturer to update the charts and get more information on a particular manufacturer in Washington. On the next dashboard I looked at ev markets by county, manufacturer, model, and type. I started with a choropleth map showing where most evs are sold in Washington, with text to show the county and the number of evs. Users can click on a county to update the dashboard. To the left there are four dropdowns where the user can filter the dashboard by manufacturer, model, county or ev type. This allows for users to segment the market however they wish and get instant geographic, price, and market information. Below this is a series of charts showing msrp, electric range, and the number of vehicles for each ev model in Washington. This gives a lot more information about which manufacturers are doing well, which price ranges are selling, and information about how electric range is distributed. Finally, I also included the total market value and ev numbers in the bottom right, because I think that is useful information no matter how the market is segmented. Both charts can be used as filters in addition to the drop-down boxes. I tried to include visualizations to give broad overviews and give the user tools to do more detailed analysis. I did not use much color except for the choropleth, and tried to make good use of text and filters.
